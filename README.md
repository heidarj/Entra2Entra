# Entra2Entra
AdminSync is a .NET 10 SCIM 2.0 server that receives provisioning events from Microsoft Entra ID and syncs them to other Entra tenants as full user accounts using the Graph API-driven inbound provisioning (bulkUpload) endpoint. Built with EF Core, itâ€™s fast, idempotent, and ready for multi-tenant expansion.
